      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Create a React.js application to demonstrate your skills in building
            a dynamic table with row selection and breadcrumb functionality.
          </li>
          <li>Use any external libraries or frameworks as needed.</li>
          <li>
            The application should fetch data from an API endpoint and populate
            the table dynamically.
          </li>
          <li>
            The table should have multiple columns, such as ID, Author, Title,
            Kind and any additional relevant data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implement row selection functionality where clicking on a row
            highlights it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Upon selecting a row, the table should be updated to display
            detailed data specific to that row.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implement breadcrumb functionality that shows the path or hierarchy
            of the selected row. For example, if the table represents a file
            system, the breadcrumb should display the path of the selected
            folder/file.
          </li>
          <li>
            The breadcrumb should be updated dynamically based on the selected
            row and allow the user to navigate back to previous levels.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use appropriate styling and layout to make the application visually
            appealing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different
            devices and screen sizes.
          </li>
        </ol>
